## Problem Overview

This Ruby script is designed to solve a coding challenge provided by Heartland. The objective is to organize and rename a collection of photos based on their metadata, specifically: name, extension, city, and time-date stamp. The renamed photos are grouped by city and sorted by the time they were taken.

## How to Use

1. Ensure that the script solution.rb and the input file input.txt are in the same directory. The input.txt file should contain the metadata of photos, each line representing a photo following the format photo-name.extension, city, yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.

2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the files.

3. Run the script using Ruby. For example: ruby solution.rb

4. The script will read the input.txt file and print out the newly organized and renamed photo names in the terminal.
